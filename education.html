                        Here you can see my full education history. Typically on a resume 
                        an employer is concerned with the high school or college, but
                        on this site you can go deeper into my history as a student. Below I list
                        each school I attended since elementary school, with a description of my 
                        time there and its impact on my life.
                    </p>
                    <h3>PS 41 (The Stephanie A. Vierno School)</h3>
                    <h4>Elementary School</h4>
                    <p>
                        I attended PS 41 from kindergarten through fifth grade—years that shaped who I am today, even if some details have faded. 
                        Many of the friendships I made there are still going strong. The highlight of my time was serving as school president in fifth grade: 
                        to campaign, I performed a rap outlining my vision for the school—and it won me the election! One change I implemented 
                        has become a lasting tradition. On rainy days, when recess moved indoors, I transformed the cafeteria into an open-mic stage, 
                        inviting students to perform songs, poems, or any talent they had. That experience taught me the power of creativity 
                        and leadership values which I carry with me in every new role I take on.

                    <h3>Marsh Avenue School for Expeditionary Learning</h3>
                    <h4>Middle School</h4>
                    <p>
                        I spent sixth through eighth grade at Marsh Middle School—a brand-new campus that felt full of possibilities. It was there I 
                        discovered my love for basketball: I started out as the team manager in seventh grade and laced up my sneakers as a player in 
                        eighth. Marsh wasn't just about hoops, though; I got to try all kinds of unique classes and even went on a camping trip to Upstate 
                        New York that still ranks among my favorite memories. Those years also taught me real responsibility—my first time commuting to 
                        and from school on my own—so I came away with a sense of independence (and a serious appreciation for a good trail mix!).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Susan E. Wagner High School</h3>
                    <h4>High School</h4>
                    <p>
                        High school at Wagner was a whole new world—jumping from about 400 classmates in middle school to nearly 4,000! 
                        I joined the Wagner Scholars program and balanced that with Key Club projects around campus. 
                        One of my proudest moments was scoring the Silver Award on the National Latin Exam after taking Latin classes. 
                        Around that time I also discovered a real passion for math—it quickly became my favorite subject. 
                        Some notable achievements I had were being inducted into the National Honor Society, competing for the track team, 
                        and scoring the Silver Award on the National Latin Exam. 
                        Between rigorous academics, club activities, and sprint drills on the track, Wagner taught me how to thrive in a 
                        big, fast-paced environment.

                    <h3>Boston University</h3>
                    <h4>College</h4>
                    <p>
                        College at Boston University has been an exciting ride. I'm majoring in Computer Science, which means I've jumped from one new 
                        language and concept to the next—everything from Python for data structures to Django for web apps—learning to pick up tools on 
                        the fly. Outside of class, I often attended Brothers United and even laced up for intramural basketball, where my team took home 
                        the co-ed championship. You can check out my hands-on projects on the Projects page. Overall, BU taught me that adapting 
                        quickly—whether to a fresh coding language or a fast-paced group project—is one of my greatest strengths.
