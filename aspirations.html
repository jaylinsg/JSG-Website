                    <h2>Short-Term Career Goals</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm hoping to start my career in financial technology at a cooperative, innovation-focused bank. In an entry-level developer or analyst role, 
                        I'd like to support enhancements to online banking tools—whether that's helping maintain secure transaction endpoints or improving user-friendly 
                        interfaces on mobile and web.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Long-Term Vision</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the next 5-10 years, I aim to take on increasing responsibility within a fintech team—perhaps leading a small project or mentoring interns. 
                        Over time I'd like to move into a senior developer or technical coordinator role, where I can help shape the direction of new banking features 
                        that make financial services more accessible.

                    <h2>Technical Passions</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've enjoyed designing clean, reliable APIs and working with data models in Django and Android. Going forward, I want to deepen my understanding 
                        of cloud-based deployments, microservices patterns, and data analysis techniques for financial applications. I also plan to keep picking up 
                        new languages and tools so I can adapt quickly to whatever stack a team needs.

                    <h2>Personal Growth &amp; Impact</h2>
                    <p>
                        Beyond coding, I'm focused on sharpening my communication and teamwork through real-world projects and code reviews. I'd also like to give back by 
                        volunteering at local coding workshops or tutoring peers, helping make technology more approachable for others.
